Hooks:
  - insert React features into our component 
  - put them at the top of the component
  - React will run this function after component is created and every time the component is updated
  
    > useState()
    > useEffect()
    > useRef()


Dependency Array:
  - control when use effect runs
  
BEST PRACTICE:
  - give useEffect a dependency array to avoid running to often
