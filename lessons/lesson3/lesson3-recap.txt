State = data that is connected to HTML
      = when we update this data, it will update the HTML
      = save data that changes overtime

- In react, we should not modify the data directly.
- We should always create a copy, and then modify the copy.

Array Destructuring  = Shortcut for updating arrays with useState
                      = The order matters

Lifting the state up = Moving the state up to the outer component 
                      = Share between multiple components
